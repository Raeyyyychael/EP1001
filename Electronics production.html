           <h2>What is electronics production?</h2>
           <p>In FDFAB, the electronics production that we are doing is the milling of a PCB (printed circuit board) <br> We are learning how to operate a CNC (Computer numerical control) machine to mill out our own PCB.</p>
          
           <h2>Why make our own PCB?</h2>
           <p>Making our own PCB allows us to have a circuit board that is taliored to our project needs, a greater reliability as well as better intergration as compared to pre-made circuit boards such as an arduino uno.</p>
           
           <h2>Milling Machine in FabLab</h2>
           <p>FabLab SP uses the Stepcraft milling machine. It is the picture below</p>
           <img src="Images/electronics%20prod%201.jpeg" height="500">
           <p>This is the recommended settings to use Stepcraft </p>
           <img src="Images/electronics%20prod%202.png" height="500">
           <p>Make sure to also check that the file is correct before milling out the circuit board!</p>
           
           <h2>Using mods</h2>
           <img src="Images/electronics%20prod%202.1.png" height="500">
           <p>How we set the settings for the g-code is by using mods. G-code is a "geometric code" which is able to tell the machine where and how fast it should move. It is the most common file format used for CNC machining. <br>
            To use mods, first "right click" and open 'programs', next 'open server program'. Scroll and find 'G-code mill 2D png' <br> Once you see the page like picture on top, you can follow the recommended setting for your file
           </p>
           <img src="Images/electronics%20prod%202.2.png" height="500">
           <p>Before milling your PCB you can also run the file using <b>CAMotics</b> to ensure that it works before using Stepcraft.</p>
           
           <h2>ISP Programmer</h2>
           <p>We were tasked to make our own ISP programmer. ISP stands for in-system programming. <br>
           This ISP programmer allows us to program our microcontroller boards when installed instead of having to pre-programme the microcontroller before installing.</p>
          <img src="Images/electronics%20prod%203%20(2).jpeg" height="500">
           <p> The picture above is the milling of the ISP</p>
           <img src="Images/electronics%20prod%204.jpeg" height="500">
           <P>The picture above is the ISP after milling</P>
           <p>Next you have to add in all the Tiny parts into your ISP programmer, the parts can be seen in the picture below which I took from Mr Noels website</p>
           <img src="Images/electronics%20prod%205.jpg" height="500">
           <p>This is my own ISP with the components soldered. IT IS NOT EASY AT ALL :( Tiny parts are no fun HAHAHA</p>
